## Overview of the analysis
Surf is a recently discovered passion of mine, and I've come up with the idea of stablishing a Surf n' Shake shop in Oahu, to provide surf boards and icecream to locals and tourists. In order to get the necessary fundings for the business, I've contacted an investor, W. Avy, who will most likely be interested (he loves surf!). The purpose of this analysis is to provide the necessary data to back up this business decision, specially based on the weather. 
W. Avy expressed a special concern about the months of June and December, so those are the focus of the analysis.

## Results
Three major points from the two analysis:
* June presents a relatively mild weather, 74.9 degrees farenheit in average.
* June's temperature ranges from 64 to 85 degrees farenheit.

* December presents lower temperatures. With an average of 71 degrees farenheit.
* December's temperature ranges from 56 to 78 degrees farenheit.

## Summary
Based on the results gathered we can conclude that June's weather is mostly good for both surfing and ice cream sales, assuming there's little rain. But given that some days might be colder, we know this might not be the most profitable month.
December's weather, on the other hand, tends to have even lower temperatures, which may impact negatively the sales of ice cream and surfing activities. 

It could be a good idea to consider a back up plan for these months where weather is not "ideal". Other types of products (food or drinks) might be sold to make up for the loss in ice cream sales and surfboards. 

Two additional queries that I would perform to gather more data are, one to determine, not just the temperature but the rain levels in the month of June, and one to determine the 3 months with the best weather (temperature and precipitation based), and the 3 months with worst weather. This will allow us to create specific business strategies for each season.
